# SimRank

This repository contains the source code implementation of SimRank and a dataset for testing the algorithm.


## Introduction


This is a Java source code implementation of the following paper:

**SimRank: A Measure of Structural-Context Similarity** ([link](http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/508/1/2001-41.pdf)).

SimRank is an algorithm used to compute the similarity among nodes in a graph, exploiting the mutual relationships among graph nodes. Considering two nodes, the more similar nodes point to them, the more similar the two nodes are. We take an example in the figure below to illustrate how SimRank works in practice.

There, node 1 is similar to node 2 since both are pointed by node 5. Comparably, node 2 is similar to node 3 as they are pointed by node 6. As a result, the two nodes \alpha and \beta are highly similar because they are concurrently pointed by other four nodes in the graph, i.e., 1, 2, 3, and 4, considering that 1 and 2 as well as 2 and 3 are pairwise similar. In this sense, the similarity between \alpha and \beta is computed by using a fixed-point function, taking into consideration the accumulative similarity by their pointing nodes. Given k >= 0 we have R^{(k)}(\alpha,\beta) = 1 with \alpha = \beta and R^{(k)}(\alpha,\beta) = 0 with k=0 and \alpha <> \beta:

We exploited sparse matrix to optimize the memory usage and thus increasing the computational performance. There is already an example embedded so that you can test the implementation. We represented a graph for GitHub repositories using various information as it can be seen in the following figure.

By exploiting this graph, we are able to compute the similarity between any pair of GitHub repositories.


## Repository Structure

This repository is organized as follows:

* The [src](./src) directory contains the implementation of the SimRank tool	
* The [Data](./Data) directory contains the dataset exploited to test the algorithm:
	* [SimRank](./SimRank): The folder that stores the similarity scores for all nodes in the graph, each file corresponds to one node.
	* [Dictionary.txt](./Data/Dictionary.txt): The file is a dictionary that contains a list of nodes together with their corresponding ID.
	* [Graph.txt](./Data/Graph.txt): It stores the graph in the the form of node1#node2, where node1 is the id of the starting node and node2 is the id of the end node.
	

By executing the code, you are able to compute the similarity between any pair of nodes in the graph.
